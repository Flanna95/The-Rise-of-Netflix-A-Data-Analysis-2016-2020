# The-Rise-of-Netflix-A-Data-Analysis-2016-2020
Netflix started in 1997 as a rent-by-mail DVD service that used a pay-per-rental model. Users of which would browse and order the films they wanted on their website, put in an order, and Netflix would post them to your door. After renters had finished with the DVDs, they would simply post them back. On July 10, 2020, Netflix became the largest entertainment company by market capitalization. The company has grown from a DVD mail order format to being the king of original content. With the impact of Covid-19 on the operation of movie theatres, and more people having to remain indoors, Netflix may soon become ‘the’ viable alternative. This data set consists of TV shows and movies released on Netflix from 2016 – 2020.
